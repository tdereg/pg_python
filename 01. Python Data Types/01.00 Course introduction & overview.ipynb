    "- `git add` takes a modified file in your working directory and places the modified version in a staging area.\n",
    "- You can add an individual file or groups of files to git tracking. To add a single file, use `git add file-name-here-with-extension`\n",
    "- To add ALL of the files that you have edited at the same time, you can use `git add --all`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `commit` the changes \n",
    " - `git commit` takes everything from the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot of the current state of your repository that is associated with a unique identifier.\n",
    " - The `git commit` command requires a commit message that describes the snapshot / changes that you made in that commit.\n",
    " - To commit a change use commad `git commit -m \"commit message\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you’ve made a few commits, check out the output of the `git log` command. You should see the history of your repository, including all of the commit messages.\n",

    "#### `fetch` the changes\n",
    "`git fetch` is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn’t do any file transferring. It’s more like just checking to see if there are any changes available).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `pull` the changes\n",
    "`git pull` on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository.\n",

    "### Commit messages\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a commit, **git** stores a commit object. You can view inforamtion atored in the commit objects for that repoitory by using `git log`. For example:\n",

    "This is most useful when you're unable to merge the two branches. For example, you might want to fix a security issue present in both branches\n",
