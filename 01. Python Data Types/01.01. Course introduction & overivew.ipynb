    "**GitHub** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.\n",

    "A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.\n",

    "**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a branch off the `master` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of `master` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `master` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram shows:\n",
    "- The `master` branch\n",
    "- A new branch called `feature` (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)\n",

    "Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.\n",
