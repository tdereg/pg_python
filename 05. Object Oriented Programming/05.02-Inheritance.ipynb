    "## Inheritance\n",
    "* Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. \n",
    "* When one class inherits from another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class.\n",
    "* The newly formed classes are called ***child classes***, the classes that we derive from are called ***parent classes*. \n",
    "* The ***child classes*** (derived) override or extend the functionality of ***paren classes*** (base).\n",
    "* The ***child class*** can inherit any or all of the attributes and methods of its ***parent class***, but it’s also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.\n",
    "* Important benefits of inheritance are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Used for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. \n",
    "* Allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents \"is-a-type-of\" relationships e.g. \n",
    "    * class `Employee` might inherit from class `Person`,\n",
    "    * all the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names e.g. class `Person` might define variables `first_name` and `last_name` with method `make_full_name()`. These will also be available in class `Employee`, which might add the variables `position` and `salary`\n",
    "* Inheritance allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way\n",
